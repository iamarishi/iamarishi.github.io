Hi, I’m Rishi. I move slowly and build things. One of the reasons I like building tools is that they were once just an idea in my head when I was diving deep into the void (getting bored), and it’s refreshing to see those ideas taking form.

There is nothing extraordinary about me, but I consider myself to be an enthusiastic learner. I am mostly driven by curiosity, deadlines, and a bit of stress. Sometimes, the factor can also be an unhealthy obsession to see the result or the fear of procrastination. On a bad day, I get to experience everything, all at once.

I have a strong passion for working towards a purpose, and I find reasonable joy in exploring the vast world of technology. My interests lie in web technologies, a tiny portion of cybersecurity, operating systems, low-level engineering, and open-source software. I’m a big fan of building automation tools and scrapping useless data from the internet. It’s fun!

In the realm of art, I find solace and inspiration. I believe that art has the power to transcend boundaries and connect us on a deeper level. I am captivated by the stories that art can tell.

I am a lifelong learner, constantly seeking new knowledge and experiences. Alongside my exploration of the art world, I have immersed myself in various subjects such as history, philosophy, and psychology. These disciplines provide me with a broader perspective that informs my understanding of art and its societal impact.

I don’t consider myself an avid reader or writer, but I do make an effort to read and write from time to time. Writing is the only way I can truly express myself, and I read because I like the idea of having something read. I have a blog where I share my thoughts and feelings, and a wiki (not public yet) which captures a good portion of my life.

I admire Aaron Swartz. He’s been a great inspiration to me for a long time.
