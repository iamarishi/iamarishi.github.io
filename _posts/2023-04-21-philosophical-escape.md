One should not rely on philosophy as a means of detachment from reality. Engaging in philosophical inquiry should not be a way to disconnect from the practical aspects of life or to seek refuge from difficult emotions or circumstances. Philosophy, at its core, is about actively engaging with the world, critically examining our beliefs, and confronting the complexities of existence.

Using philosophy as an escape can hinder personal development. It is essential to acknowledge that real growth occurs through action, experience, and the integration of philosophical insights into our daily lives. Merely retreating into philosophical contemplation without applying those insights to our actions and interactions would limit the true potential of philosophy to transform us and our understanding of the world.
