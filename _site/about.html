<p>Hi, I’m Rishi. I move slowly and build things. One of the reasons I like building tools is that they were once just an idea in my head when I was diving deep into the void (getting bored), and it’s refreshing to see those ideas taking form.</p>

<p>There is nothing extraordinary about me, but I consider myself to be an enthusiastic learner. I am mostly driven by curiosity, deadlines, and a bit of stress. Sometimes, the factor can also be an unhealthy obsession to see the result or the fear of procrastination. On a bad day, I get to experience everything, all at once.</p>

<p>I have a strong passion for working towards a purpose, and I find reasonable joy in exploring the vast world of technology. My interests lie in web technologies, a tiny portion of cybersecurity, operating systems, low-level engineering, and open-source software. I’m a big fan of building automation tools and scrapping useless data from the internet. It’s fun!</p>

<p>Beside technology, I have a keen interest in various subjects, including History, Philosophy, Politics, Religion, Neuroscience and Psychology. I find it sort of rewarding to explore and gain insights into these topics, as they offer a different perspective on the world around me. I hold expertise on none, but I approach these subjects with an open mind and a desire to learn and understand more without any preconceived notions or biases.</p>

<p>I don’t consider myself an avid reader or writer, but I do make an effort to read and write from time to time. Writing is the only way I can truly express myself, and I read because I like the idea of having something read. I have a blog where I share my thoughts and feelings, and a wiki (not public yet) which captures a good portion of my life.</p>

<p>I admire Aaron Swartz. He’s been a great inspiration to me for a long time.</p>
